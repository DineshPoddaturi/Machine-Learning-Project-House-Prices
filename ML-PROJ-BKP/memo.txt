memo of Report

In this report, we need to describe our attempts to create useful features, implement machine learning algorithms, and combine, or stack, predictions in an effective way. 

Further more, we detail our efforts to gauge how well our predictions would perform on test data, through cross-validation. 

Finally, we would reflect on the lessons we learned through this competition. 


Note: 




We need to check the scatter plot of price vs date (ymd)# Was the house sold in summer (hot season)?

PCR to reduce the dimension of features? 

Transform integers to numerical?

Remove price outliers?


Stacking:

knn, gbm, rf, xgboost (Kelly Sun)

knn, mlr, tree (Dinesh)

knn, xgboost (Zhaoxin)
