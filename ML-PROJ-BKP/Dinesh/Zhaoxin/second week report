in second week I try knn(9  175890.4  0.7960958  90762.21), linear regression and Enet(  1.0e-04  15000   48000.35  0.9880368  28569.60). Knn outperformes other two methods with better RMSE and scores.
More importantly, after our group discuss feature selection process, we consider drop 5 variables from the trainning and test data (sqft_living,lot,view,above,basement), and two additional variables (add indicated for removated and recently build>2000). Initially, RMSE in knn inccrease. Then we decide to keep sqft_living and sqft_basement, that move gives best RMSE in knn with ( 5  173149.0  0.7962411  89539.54). So sqft_living and sqft_basement do give us more information in predicting house price.
